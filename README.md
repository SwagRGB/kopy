# kopy

A high-performance file synchronization tool written in Rust, designed as a safe and robust alternative to `rsync` for local directory syncing.

## Under Construction

> **Note:** This project is currently in **Alpha**. The core type system is implemented, but the CLI and sync engine are still being assembled.

## Overview

kopy aims to provide a reliable syncing engine with a focus on data safety. It features a strict type system, atomic operations, and configurable delete modes (including a "Trash" safety net) to prevent accidental data loss.
