# The "Holy Trinity" of Context
You must strictly adhere to the project documentation found in the root directory:
1. `implementation_plan.md`: The technical blueprint. NEVER deviate from the algorithms or data structures defined here without explicit user permission.
2. `task.md`: The source of truth for current progress and task phases.
3. `about_project.md`: The product vision and UX philosophy.
